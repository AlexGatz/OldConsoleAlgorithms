# someUsefulConsoleAlgorithms
## Summary
This is a set of console programs written in C++ that I wrote in 2014 while taking a basic algorithm design class. At the time the only requirements for the class was to create a program that would take in some sort of user input and output the requested result. The professor did not care how neat the code looked, or how the output looked in the console. I tried to go above and beyond to make the code look fairly need and also include as many comments as I could so to be able to come back at a later time and 

There are some useful concepts in the code and at the time I tried to focus on creating easy to read and functional code. Each program is very similar as they all used console input and output. Basic object oriented programming was used via simple functions. Perhaps something here can be useful to someone else either working on their own algorithm design homework, or other projects.
